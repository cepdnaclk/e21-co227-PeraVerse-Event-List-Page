## Introduction

 This is a full-stack event management web application developed as a comprehensive platform for browsing and interacting with events.

Our team was responsible for building the Events Dashboard with interactive features, which serves as the user's main interaction point for viewing detailed event information, marking attendance, rating events, commenting, and filtering by categories. This application is fully responsive, cloud-ready, and connected to a real backend API with Supabase database integration.

## Solution & Impact

The Event List Page provides:

- Clear interface for exploring event information
- Dynamic attendance system (replacing the "interested" system)
- Real-time updates for attendance counts and attendee lists
- Interactive rating system with 1-5 stars and averages
- Comprehensive comment system for feedback
- Category-based filtering for event discovery
- Direct Supabase integration for instant synchronization
- Complete REST API with Swagger documentation
- Modern, cloud-hosted full-stack experience
